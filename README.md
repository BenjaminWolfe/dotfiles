# dotfiles

The [Everyday Carry][edc] for my personal setup, so to speak.
It's meant to help me get set up on a new Mac.
See [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) to get started.

## Automated Set-Up

Run [scripts/main-setup.sh](scripts/main-setup.sh) to set everything up!

```sh
cd ~/.dotfiles/scripts
./main-setup.sh
```

You can then double-click on `~/.dotfiles/vscode/palomar.code-workspace`
straight from Finder and it should open VS Code to a workspace
of all the relevant repos.

## Manual Customizations

Continue with the manual (and usually optional) customizations
from [manual-customizations.md](manual-customizations.md).
